if we lost the pem key unfortunately   
we will do some procedure to reassign the pem 
1. we need to launch one more ec2 instance in same vpc and same subnet and sg ,and create a new key pair for newly created instances.
2. stooped the old instance and detach the volume from old instances. and attached volume to newly created instances 
3. do the lsblk command we knew its not mounted the new=-volume yet now
4. do the lsblk -f it shows the blocks of ebs \
5. start the mount  form using these command  ----->>>>> [ mount -o rw,nouuid /dev/xvdf  /mnt/ ]
6. check the mounted the volume or not and observe the weather root ebs has added or no using the ls -alh /mnt/ 
7. if the output shows the root directories, the mount has completed.
8. then copy the authorized-keys from present instance to /mnt/ directory 
   ex:  [cp /home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized keys /mnt/home/ec2-user/.ssh/authorized_keys]
9. check the both authorizes key are same or not ,  if the both keys are same we can umount  the mnt[ umount /mnt ] by using these command umnount the volumes 
 and detached from instances to attached orginal instances at the time attaching we need to mention the root volume type  /dev/xvda   
10. /dev/xvda is the root ebs name,  if we doesn't put these name instance doesn't start 
11. 
12. try to the access instance with new pair key
