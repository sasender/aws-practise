 A backup plan is a policy expression that defines when and how you want to back up your AWS resources, such as DynamoDB tables or Amazon EFS file systems.
 You can assign resources to backup plans, and AWS Backup then automatically backs up and retains backups for those resources according to the backup plan. You can create multiple backup plans if you have workloads with different backup requirements.

Backup jobs are records created when a backup is initiated either as a scheduled backup or an on-demand backup.
back up jobs provide relevant information about the our back up such as the status of the job
